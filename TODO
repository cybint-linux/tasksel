- show already installed tasks
- language tasks like spanish that include stuff like mozilla-locale-es-es
  and openoffice.org-l10n-es pull in all of mozilla and openoffice, which
  is often not the desired effect. Fixes would include:
    - make these packages only recommend the main packages
    - put the language packages in the tasks that pull in OOo and mozilla
      (but this is hard to maintain)
    - stop this translation splitting nonsense
