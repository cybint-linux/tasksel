Task Selection UI v0.1
Nov 20, 1999
Randolph Chung <tausq@debian.org>

Here's a first cut at a task selection user interface.

The interface GUI is based on libslang. It has no other special library 
dependencies.

On startup, the tasksel program will read
/usr/share/tasksel/debian-tasks.desc for information about what tasks are
available and their descriptions and sections. Next it will read the output
of apt-cache dumpavail. Task: fields can be used to state that a package
belongs to a task or tasks. Also, the package names are used to identify
task packages (matching "task-*").

The tasks will be presented in a simple list selection screen with
their short descriptions.  Users can drill down into the tasks to
see detailed descriptions and some information about the packages in the
task.

On exit, tasksel executes the appropriate apt-get command to install the
selected packages. If the -t option is given, then tasksel prints out the
command line to use to stdout instead. All other messages are printed to
stderr.

The appropriate display strings in the source have been marked with gettext 
macros, though I have never done any other i18n work and am not sure if it 
is done correctly at the moment.

A word on building.... use make CFLAGS="-Os" to get a smaller binary. The
default build rule produces binaries with debugging symbols. You can also
turn on -DDEBUG to get extra debugging info.

Comments and suggestions are most welcome.

To get a new task added, please file a bug report on tasksel.
