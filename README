The interface uses debconf for consistency with the rest of the Debian
installer.

On startup, the tasksel program will read all *.desc files in
/usr/share/tasksel/ for information about what tasks are available. The
tasks will be presented in a simple list selection screen with their short
descriptions.

On exit, tasksel executes the appropriate apt-get command to install the
selected packages. If the -t option is given, then tasksel prints out the
command line to use to stdout instead. All other messages are printed to
stderr.

To get a new task added, please file a bug report on tasksel.

Debian derived distributions can add a new .desc file to
/usr/share/tasksel/ to add additional tasks, or modify/divert
debian-tasks.desc to remove tasks.
