Task: desktop
Section: user
Description: desktop environment
 This task provides basic "desktop" software, including a variety
 of session managers, file managers and web browsers. It incorporates
 both the GNOME and KDE desktops, and provides a display manager
 which lets the user choose between the two.
Packages:
  # FIXME: not in a releasable state until it pulls in X too!
  # task-x-window-system-core (?)
  # TODO: we really should have kde and gnome meta-packages, which this
  # task could just pull in, rather than having to track all of kde and
  # gnome here.
