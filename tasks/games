Task: games
Section: user
Description: Games
 Selecting this task will install a broad selection of games, from
 traditional textual unix games to card games, to fast-paced arcade games.
 It won't install all the games in Debian, but it is a good starting point.
Packages:
# TODO: more games can be included now that this is not a package.
# Please only add very good, complete, classic or well-known games though.
# It would be good to have some emulators, if any are in main.
