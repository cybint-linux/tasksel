# Scan the directory for files, and use the files to generate a task
# description file. The format of the task description file is described in
# tata.c. The format of the input files is:
#
# Task: desktop
# Section: user
# Description: Provide a basic GUI system
#  This task provides functionality for a basic desktop; whether Gnome
#   based, KDE based or customised. With this task, your system will boot
#   into a graphical login screen, at which point you can choose which of
#   these desktops you wish to use on a per-user basis. You can further
#   customise your desktop once installed.
# Packages:
#  kdebase
#  gdm
#  ...
#
# Hash-comments are allowed in the files, but must be on their own lines.
